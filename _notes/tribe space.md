## raw notes
- what is one skill everyone should have
- dialectic synthesis
- seeing the conversation between people as separate
	- to separate from the ego
	- embodying the synthesis - to see it as a separate thing
	- a conversation can be seen as a separate thing
	- also indicates the depth of miscommunication
- crafting a separate "thing" with ideas, treat 
- embodying the conversation as a "thing"
- importance of active listening
- seek to understand others perspectives before arguing
- elevate humans capacity for understanding and dealing with complexity
- seeking to embrace and understand complexity is a necessary skill in the modern world
-  creating  a diety out of goals - anthromophising action, narratives
	-  why do we anthropomorphize things
	-  understanding other things through the lens of humans
-  how deep our miscommunication is/can be
-  relating with other people , how important it is to put aside ego
	-  put aside ego and pride - takes humility to seek others perspectives
-  find sense of self in our goals
	-  if poking holes in that goal, then poking holes in identity
	-  goal behind political leanings - showing interrelated goals
	-  pointing out flaws in our line of thinking
-  dig deep enough we all share fundamental values
-  goals vs ideas
	-  identy associated with goals, we believe ideas and goals are action oriented
	-  goal - social validation
-  empathy begets depth
	-  a lot of mediums don't enable depth
	-  trapped in the surface layer
-  being wrong, really not scared of being wrong - but scared of 
-  psychological safety as necessary to integrate feedback from other people
	-  being wrong is hard, and being judged is difficult, if we have psychological safety
-  fear based - opposite of psychological safety
	-  deities, believe its something because not knowing is not an option
	-  inherent understanding being in uncomfortable situation
-  mytho-poetic narrative in religions, making people comfortable with circumstances they don't know anything about
-  religion and spirituality as a means to be psychological comfortable with death
- bringing the uncertain and unknown into the known - anthropomorphising, narratives, etc.
- addiction to complexity?
	- as long as any idea is part of identity, succeptible to zealotry
- see these meetings as means to improve model
	- something in the world that I care about, if have a better model, means can be more effective at working towards that goal
	- get at whatever thing you care about
- focusing on goals, rather than ideas, means being able to upgrade ideas
- people really want a healthy relationship to the unknown, people want to be adaptable,
	- increase the ability to do that
	- healthy relationship with the unknown
- competence about complexity and uncertainty, how to feel competent
	- what does competence with uncertainty look like
	- find your sphere of influence
- the more you know, the more you know you don't know
	- no choice but to come to grips with the unknown
	- if going to continue functioning, need to have a healthy relationship with it
- we do have the ability to update our models
- coherent map of reality as possible
- epistemic humility vs nihilism element
	- that is the skill - epistemic humility
		- what does it take to be epistemically humble?
- narrative mapping - like what cynefin does
	- do what humans are good at doing, like partial scanning info, telling stories, 
	- distributed ethnography
- how to get narrative maps of reality to converge with abstract, empirical maps
- narrative mapping of reality
	- adaptive or useful maps?
	- assumes less or predicts more - 
- what are heuristics of narratives - to guide their evolutionary development
	- selection mechanisms of narratives?
	- they definitely need to be tested
- markov blankets
	- usefulness and hinderance of creating barriers around things
	- think what narrative is doing - creating compartments for things - creating a walled garden
	- take things and compartmentalize
	- like the constraints of alphabet - grammars of language
	- grammars as a enabling constraint
	- the alphabet as an enabling constraint for expressive capacity
- constraints of human behaviour - how do we turn human boundaries into enabling constraints for social coherence
- link up brains - how well can peoples eperience be mapped for other people
- upgrade in grammatic capacities - 


## processed notes
- [[treating conversation threads as external entities allows for richer dialectic synthesis]]
	-  By externalizing and relabelling ones map of reality, it becomes easier to seek others perspectives
- [[sense of self is inherently coupled with our goals]]
- dieties and narratives as maps for shared understanding
- [[by associating our identity with goals, we can be more open to integrating new ideas]]
- psychological safety vs fear
	- [[psychological safety is a necessary precursor for epistemic humility]]
- confronting uncertainty and complexity
- [[the pursuit of comfort can prevent us from confronting uncertainty]] 
- coherent maps of reality
- epistemic humility
- sphere of influence
- working within the constraints of human behaviour
- evolutionary development of narratives
- boundaries, coherence, enabling constraints etc,
