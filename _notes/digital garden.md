A digital garden is a public set of networked notes, usually adhering to [[zettelkasten]]-like note-taking principles. 

The main purpose of this digital garden is to map our ongoing [[dialectic synthesis]] that takes place during our [[tribe space]] conversations. This networked map will hopefully strengthen our discourse and promote the synthesis process.

We are also using it as an experiment to structure our growing [[glossary]] list.
