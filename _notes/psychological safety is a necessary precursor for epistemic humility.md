Epistemic humility entails accepting the idea that we can be wrong and that our beliefs may be false. But openly admiting when we are wrong is difficult. We fear the judgement that other people show when we make mistakes. That's why when we feel comfortable making mistakes, we can be more epistemically humble.

One way to think of epistemic humility is that it is holding ideas lightly and goals strongly: [[by associating our identity with goals, we can be more open to integrating new ideas]].
