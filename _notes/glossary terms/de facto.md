De facto or “in fact” is an expression describing the actual state of things in contrast to the legal or hypothetical one. As an adverbial expression de facto means the same as “actually”, and as an adjective it means the same as “actual”. As an example, a nation might have a de facto leader (a head of a military junta) and a hypothetical one (a powerless king).
